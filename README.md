# Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my projects portfolio! This repository contains the following projects:

## 1. Optimal trade execution using ML and RL 
- **Description:** This is my Master's thesis in which I've used many different machine learning models to predict stock prices.
- **File:** [Master's.pdf](praca_magisterska (8).pdf)

## 2. Cars EDA + Machine Learning

- **Description:** This Jupyter notebook explores an automobile dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. It also includes some machine learning models for predicting certain features related to automobiles.
- **File:** [EDA_ML.ipynb](Cars_EDA_machine_learning/EDA_ML.ipynb)

## 3. NFT data mining

- **Description:** This Jupyter notebook analyzes some nfts showing their attributes, ranking them based on rarity.
- **File:** [nft.ipynb](nft/nft.ipynb)

## 4. Destiny 2 Player Activity Analysis

- **Description:** This Jupyter notebook analyzes Destiny 2 player activity data to gain insights into player behavior and engagement with the game.
- **File:** [d2_project.ipynb](d2_project/d2_project.ipynb)

## 5. Optimization Task using Frank-Wolfe Method

- **Description:** This Jupyter notebook implements an optimization task using the Frank-Wolfe method, demonstrating its application in solving optimization problems.
- **File:** [Optimization.ipynb](Optimization/Optimization.ipynb)

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks locally, you'll need Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
